# Anagrams-of-Words

This project involves working with Python data containers such as lists and dictionaries to manipulate a dataset of word anagrams.

Task 1: Load the dataset from a zip file, listing the files within it.
Task 2: Read a dictionary of English words, clean and process them (removing leading/trailing spaces, lowercase conversion, removing duplicates, sorting alphabetically).
Task 3: Group words from the cleaned list by their lengths into a dictionary.
Task 4: Find anagrams for each group of words with the same length and store them in a dictionary, ensuring that only groups with more than one anagram are considered.
The final output includes organized dictionaries representing words by length and their corresponding anagrams
